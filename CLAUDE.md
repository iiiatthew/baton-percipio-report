# Baton-Percipio Connector Refactor Project Memory

## Project Overview

refactored the baton-percipio-reportconnector to simplify data retrieval by using only the learning activity report instead of separate user and course API endpoints.

## Completed Objectives

1. ✅ Removed dependency on user and course API endpoints
2. ✅ Extract all necessary user and course data from the learning activity report
3. ✅ Simplified user resource to only: id, email, firstName, lastName
4. ✅ Simplified course resource to only: id, name
5. ✅ Removed client-side pagination and limitCourses functionality
6. ✅ Maintained all SDK/C1 interaction functionality as-is

## Implementation Summary

### Data Sources (After Refactor)

- **Single Source**: Learning Activity Report provides all data
- **Users**: Extracted from report entries (no API calls)
- **Courses**: Extracted from report entries (no API calls)

### Report Structure (LearnerActivity)

Contains all needed data:

- User info: `userId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `emailAddress`
- Course info: `contentUuid`, `contentId`, `contentTitle`
- Status info: `status` (for grants/entitlements)
- Date fields: `completedDate`, `firstAccess`, `lastAccess` (for determining most recent data)

### Implemented Flow

1. Generate/retrieve report during connector initialization
2. userBuilder → Extract unique users from report (using most recent entry per user)
3. courseBuilder → Extract unique courses from report
4. Grants → Use already-loaded report data

## Implementation Details

1. **Course ID Field**: Using `contentId` as primary identifier
2. **Report Generation Timing**: Report is generated during connector initialization
3. **User Deduplication**: Extract unique users by userId, using data from the most recent report entry based on activity dates (completedDate > lastAccess > firstAccess)
4. **Course Filtering**: No filtering needed - report already contains only courses
5. **Missing Data**: Logging warnings in human-readable format for missing fields
6. **Resource Order**: No specific ordering, focused on uniqueness
7. **Caching Strategy**: Maintained existing StatusesStore pattern

## Refactor Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Updated Data Models ✅

- Simplified User struct: ID, Email, FirstName, LastName only
- Simplified Course struct: ID (using contentId), Name (contentTitle) only
- Updated ReportEntry struct to include necessary fields and date tracking

### Phase 2: Refactored Report Flow ✅

- Report generation moved to connector initialization
- Report is loaded once and stored in Connector struct
- Report data available throughout connector lifecycle via GetLoadedReport()

### Phase 3: Implemented Resource Extraction ✅

- User extraction:
  - Deduplicates by userId
  - Uses most recent user data based on activity dates
  - Priority: completedDate > lastAccess > firstAccess
  - Logs warnings for missing fields
- Course extraction:
  - Deduplicates by contentId
  - No filtering needed (report pre-filtered)
  - Logs warnings for missing course data

### Phase 4: Updated Builders ✅

- userBuilder refactored to use report data directly
- courseBuilder refactored to use report data directly
- Grant/entitlement logic maintained using StatusesStore
- StatusesStore updated to use ContentId instead of ContentUUID

### Phase 5: Cleanup Complete ✅

- Removed GetUsers and GetCourses API methods
- Removed all pagination logic and constants
- Removed limitCourses functionality entirely
- Removed unused structs from models.go
- Cleaned up all orphaned code

## Completed Implementation Tasks

1. ✅ Read and analyze refactor plan
2. ✅ Examine current codebase structure
3. ✅ Create CLAUDE.md memory file
4. ✅ Identify gaps/ambiguities in refactor plan
5. ✅ Review and propose improvements
6. ✅ Phase 1: Update User and Course structs in models.go
7. ✅ Phase 2: Move report generation to connector initialization
8. ✅ Phase 3-Prep: Remove limitCourses functionality
9. ✅ Phase 3A: Implement user extraction from report data
10. ✅ Phase 3B: Implement course extraction from report data
11. ✅ Phase 4A: Update userBuilder to use report data
12. ✅ Phase 4B: Update courseBuilder to use report data
13. ✅ Phase 5: Remove unused API methods and cleanup code

## Key Implementation Changes

### User Data Handling

- Users are extracted from learning activity report entries
- Each user's data is taken from their most recent activity entry
- Activity recency determined by: completedDate > lastAccess > firstAccess
- No data consistency verification needed - just use latest data

### Course Data Handling

- Courses are extracted directly from report entries
- Deduplicated by contentId
- No filtering required (report already contains only courses)

### Status Mapping

- Updated to map all Percipio statuses correctly:
  - Completed, Achieved, Listened, Read, Watched → "completed"
  - Started, Active → "in_progress"
  - All others → "in_progress" (default)

### Architecture Changes

- Single data source: Learning Activity Report
- Report loaded once during initialization
- No API calls to /users or /courses endpoints
- No pagination logic
- No limitCourses functionality

## Code References

- User model: `pkg/client/models.go` (simplified struct)
- Course model: `pkg/client/models.go` (simplified struct)
- ReportEntry model: `pkg/client/models.go` (includes date fields)
- Report generation: `pkg/client/percipio.go:GenerateLearningActivityReport`
- Report loading: `pkg/connector/connector.go:New()` (initialization)
- userBuilder: `pkg/connector/users.go` (extracts from report)
- courseBuilder: `pkg/connector/courses.go` (extracts from report)

## Refactor Complete

The baton-percipio-reportconnector has been successfully refactored to use a single data source (learning activity report) for all user and course information. The implementation is simpler, more efficient, and maintains all required functionality.
